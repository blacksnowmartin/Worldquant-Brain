O90WorldQuant's BRAIN platform is designed for users to develop and test quantitative trading strategies, known as "alphas." These alphas are mathematical models that aim to predict the future price movements of financial instruments. While the specific formulas and strategies are proprietary and confidential, here are some general categories and examples of alphas that can be developed on the BRAIN platform:

1. Statistical Arbitrage Alphas:

- Mean Reversion: Identifies assets whose prices have deviated significantly from their historical averages and bets on them reverting back.
- Pairs Trading: Exploits temporary price discrepancies between two historically correlated assets.
- Volatility Trading: Capitalizes on predictions of future volatility levels.

2. Fundamental Alphas:

- Value Investing: Identifies undervalued companies based on financial ratios like price-to-earnings or price-to-book.
- Growth Investing: Predicts future earnings growth based on factors like revenue growth, market share, or innovation.
- Quality Investing: Focuses on companies with strong balance sheets, high profitability, and stable earnings.

3. Technical Analysis Alphas:

- Trend Following: Identifies and rides the direction of established price trends.
- Momentum Strategies: Capitalizes on the continuation of recent price movements.
- Pattern Recognition: Identifies and exploits recurring chart patterns.

4. Sentiment Analysis Alphas:

- News Sentiment: Analyzes news articles and social media to gauge investor sentiment and predict price movements.
- Social Media Trends: Identifies trending topics and discussions on social media platforms to predict changes in asset prices.
